# MLProject

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development and implementation of a machine learning pipeline for [project purpose, e.g., classification or regression tasks]. The pipeline covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using [algorithm used, e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks].
